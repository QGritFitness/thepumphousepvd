					<p class="script" style="padding-top:20px;">Your neighborhood gym just got a little gayer...</p>
					<br>
					<p>The Pump Room is Providence, RI’s first trans and queer-owned gym and juice bar concept that centers and celebrates every body that has historically been left out of the fitness narrative. 
						<br><br>
						Our space is a true judgement-free zone, where anyone of any identity, gender, size, and ability can move freely and confidently with other members of their community, and most importantly have FUN. With ethereal neon vibes evocative of 80’s malls, Miami Vice, and 80’s synth music, it’s always a party here. 
						<br><br>
						Come check us out when we’re up and running - your first visit is on us!
						<br><br>
						** We are currently in the fundraising stage and would appreciate your support!! Please visit our indiegogo page <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/project/preview/2e3a306e#/">here</a> to help fund this project and bring it to life! 
						<br><br>
						** Pre-sale memberships are also available with early bird pricing!! Memberships will be limited to the first 150 people, so make sure you secure your spot ASAP!</p>
